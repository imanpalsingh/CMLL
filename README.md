# CMLL
<h1> CMLL : C++'s Machine Learning Library (version 0.0.0) </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
CMLL is a Machine Learning Library for C++ that is build from scratch using just C++ 17and uses the C++17's STL. The matrix and other computational requirements are also written from scratch. The aim of this library is to provide easier creation, manipulation and deployment of Machine Learning models in C++.

<h2> Description </h2> 
This project is orignally my submission of 'Minor Project' for 6th semester,Computer Science Engineering. It is still in deveopment phase and isn't yet implemented as a functional library. The modules are being developled and will be added.

<h2> Current Goals </h2>
The goals of this library are
<h3>1) Data preprocessing in C++ </h3>
Priovide data preprocessing tools for data cleaning and other manipulation and extraction techniques.
<h3>2) Data visualization </h3>
With the help of OpenGL provide 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualization of datasets,models etc.
<h3>3) Model creation </h3>
Creation of various machine learning models and their deployment with high level api format along with the full controllability.

<h2> Current Functionalities </h2>
The library currently supports following features
<h4>1) Data handling </h4>
Data handling includes : Data extraction, loading, preprocessing
<h4>2) Model creation </h4>
The library supports creation of following models :

<h4> Supervised Learning </h4>
<h5> Regression </h5>
(i) Linear Regression <br> 
(ii) Ridge Regression<br>
(iii) K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
<h5> Classification </h5>
(i) Logistic Regression<br>
(ii) Naive Bayes Classifier<br>
(iii) K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier<br>
(iv) Ridge Classifier
<br>
<h4> Unsupervised Learning </h4>
<h5> Clustering</h5>
(i) K-Means clustering
